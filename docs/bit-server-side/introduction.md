# Bit server side introduction

You can develop server side apps using Bit framework.

Your app can be hosted on [Traditional ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/) or [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)
You can use ASP.NET Core with Full .NET Framework 4.6.1+ or with .NET Core 3.0+

By the abstraction we provide to you, **you develop no matter you choose ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET Traditional or ASP.NET Core with .NET Core.** You develop on ASP.NET Core the same way as you develop on ASP.NET Traditional. Only configurations between those platforms are different.

We also watch your code in real time to inform you about common mistakes. For example, if you use some classes which are not part of ASP.NET Core / .NET Core, you'll see something like this:
